## Overview

This project is a fun way to use what I learned in JavaScript so far and make a game out of it. The overall purpose is simple. The player tries to guess the secret number that is randomly choosen by the computer. You have a limited number of tries to try to guess the number and if not then you lose. Your highscore will also be saved each run if it's your current best score, as long as you click the reset button. If you reload the page completely using the browser, then the highscore will reset back to zero.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Input a guess and check if it's the correct number
- Reset the game at anytime

### What I learned

I learned how use HTML and Javascript together to manipulate the DOM and change the interactivity and styling of my web page.

This project took a decent level of understanding how to implement logic into my code and basic problem solving skills. I will most certainly continue to improve my logic skills in future projects.
